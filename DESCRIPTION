Description: nmecr builds statistical energy data models and provides a comprehensive assessment of model fit and prediction accuracy.
  The modeling algortihms are derivatives of linear regression and have been enhanced for energy data modeling by various industry efforts 
  (ASHRAE RP 1040, LBNL-4944E).
